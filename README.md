# Increasing-Productivity-and-Revenue-to-1-Million-while-Decreasing-Unplanned-Downtime-of-Machines

Description:

This repository showcases an exploration of machine sensor data using both Python and SQL.  This project provides valuable insights for:

Recruiters: Demonstrates your proficiency in data analysis techniques using Python and SQL, essential skills for data science and machine learning roles.
Data Analysts/Scientists: Explores a practical EDA workflow using both programming and querying languages, highlighting your understanding of data exploration strategies.
Project Goals (Align with Project Charter):

[Summarize key objectives and deliverables from the project charter here. Briefly explain how this exploration aligns with those goals.]
Gain insights into the data's characteristics and distribution (mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, etc.).
Identify potential anomalies, outliers, and patterns for further investigation.
Prepare the data for potential machine learning applications (cleaning, feature engineering).
Contents:

data.csv (or your actual data file name): Contains the raw machine sensor data.
python_eda.py (or your Python script name): The Python script performing EDA.
sql_queries.sql (or your SQL script name): An optional file for SQL-based EDA.
README.md (this file): Provides an overview of the project and findings.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

I. Python Approach:

The python_eda.py script utilizes Python libraries to perform a comprehensive exploration:

Libraries: Leverages libraries like pandas for data manipulation, and visualization libraries like matplotlib or seaborn for creating insightful plots.

Data Loading and Cleaning: Loads data from data.csv and handles missing values, data types, and potential inconsistencies, ensuring data quality.

Descriptive Statistics: Calculates summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum) for each sensor feature, providing insights into central tendency, spread, and potential outliers.

Visualization: Generates informative visualizations like histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots. These visualizations help identify patterns, trends, and potential outliers within the data.

Moment Analysis: Computes first moment (mean, median, mode), second moment (variance, standard deviation), and third moment (skewness) for each feature, offering deeper insights into central tendency, spread, and asymmetry.

Business Decision Insights: Relates EDA findings to potential business decisions concerning:

Product quality control (e.g., identifying features impacting product quality)
Process optimization (e.g., optimizing processes based on sensor data trends)
Risk assessment (e.g., identifying potential risks based on sensor measurements)
II. SQL Approach (Optional):

If the data resides in a relational database, consider using sql_queries.sql for preliminary exploration:

Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (AVG, MEDIAN, MIN, MAX) for each sensor feature directly within the database for quick insights.

Data Filtering and Grouping: Use WHERE and GROUP BY clauses to filter and group data based on specific conditions and explore trends across different categories.

Visualization (Optional): Export results to a Python environment for further visualization using libraries like matplotlib or seaborn (if data volume allows).

Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

Python (version 3.x recommended) with libraries like pandas, matplotlib (optional), and seaborn (optional).
SQL client or database access tools if using the SQL approach.
Clone the Repository: Use git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git to clone this repository.

Run Python Script:

Navigate to the repository directory.
Ensure required libraries are installed (pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn).
Execute python python_eda.py. This will generate visualizations and output key findings in the console or potentially as saved plots.
Run SQL Queries (Optional):

If using SQL, import the data into your database or ensure access to the existing database.
Execute the sql_queries.sql script within your SQL client to obtain preliminary insights.
Further Exploration:

Experiment with different EDA techniques and visualizations.
Consider feature engineering to create new informative features (especially in Python).
Implement machine learning algorithms (if applicable) using Python libraries like scikit-learn to extract predictive insights from the data.
